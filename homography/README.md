# Homography Transformation

This project demonstrates how to perform homography transformations using OpenCV. The goal is to transform a tennis court image into a bird's-eye view using a homography matrix.


## Usage
1. Run the notebook to load images.
2. Select 4 corresponding points on the source and destination images.
3. View the results.

## Notes
- Ensure the images are in the `images/` directory.
- Use `%matplotlib tk` for interactive point selection.
